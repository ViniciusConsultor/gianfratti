1/ What is the hierarchy of Fullxml ?
The hierarchy is pretty simple :

CATEGORIES: the menu blocks 
    |
    |
  PAGES: the webpages
	|
	|
ARTICLES: Every content of the site (left/right, margin/headline/ story, ...)


2/ How can I activate and use the Reaction add-on ?
The reaction module allow user to react to an article by writing/posting a comment.
This reaction module can only be activate on article that have a headline and a body. 
To activate the module on an article: in the advanced option of this article, set the "Show article tool bar" option to "on"

The posted reactions have to be moderate and moderate in order to appear online. To acced to it in the admin, go under "Moderation/Reaction".

3/ Language/Encoding
The encoding is NOT auto-selected.
I will try to explain why: changing to different encoding than then one used for your language can screw up your new article or article you modify with this bad encoding.
So when choosing "language", you have to select manually then good encoding (as indicated near the language).
 
 
Admin Menu -----

<<PAGES>>
---------

The blue 'globe' represents whether or not the page is visible or not

Where does the ID of the page come into play and what is the importance of it?

*How do 'pages' relate to Categories and how can I use that to my advantage in designing my web site?


<<CONTENTS>>
------------

(same as above with the globe and ID of the 'content')

How does my Webpage in my contents relate to each other?

Is there any way to change the ID # of already defined Contents?


<<CATEGORIES>>
--------------

When I define a Category what can I 'link' it to?  What can I put underneath them?

Are there only two access types, Anonymous & Members Only?


<<SETTINGS>>
------------

Are my Meta Keywords able to be seen by search engine robots?

By accident I changed my encoding field to Windows-1250 but I don't remember what it was originally; how can I find out what it was and what should it be?  Does it matter?

If I can add content to my homepage as a headline or such why is there a Frontpage section here?  How is it different from other ways I put content on my homepage?

Is the media/logo.gif path the one under fullXML or admin?  Where should I store images?

Register default status on/off - what does this affect?  Registered users?  What is on or off about them?


<<SURVEYS>>
-----------

Is there a limit to how many I can have at once?  Can both anonymous AND registered members see them and vote?  Is it possible to vote more than once?


<<QUOTATIONS>>
--------------

(Same as Surveys)


<<FORUMS>>

Is the Visibility option just an easy way to turn a forum on or off basically?

Why can't I use the built-in HTML editor for the description here?


<<BANNERS>>
-----------

All of my ID #'s are out of order.  Will that affect anything?  

Does the click count just count total times someone has clicked on a banner or unique clicks?

(Good place to mention, if not done somewhere else already, about the mandatory http:// absolute URL with Banner links)


<<DOWNLOADS>>
-------------

Is it all right to leave fields blank if I don't need them?  (for instance, you have a concert schedule that is changing every few days but it doesn't have a version #, Editors website (because you are already on the site), the size changes, and has no price)

What does the publication date have to do with anything?  Do I need it there? 


<<MEMBER MANAGER>>
------------------

Does any email validity checking go on when a member registers?  

Is it possible to have too many Administrators if I happen to be running a collabrative website and many others need access to the admin functions?  

Is it possible to limit the admin functions of certain individuals?

Newsletter?  What newsletter?


<<REACTION MANAGER>>
--------------------

How does the Reaction Manager relate to anything else on fullXML?  

How can I use the information here to my advantage in any way?


<<TRAFFIC ANALYSIS>>
--------------------

I like the information contained in the traffic analysis but is there a place where I can see the IP Address resolved?

The URL looks like just a page from my site or something - what is the purpose?

Is it possible for me to change the colors of the bar chart within Traffic Analysis?  I'm epeleptic and RED can make me go into a seizure.


<<DESKTOP>>
-----------

I understand what the 'stats' are for (how many things to validate and such) but what is the task list for?  










<!--
The webmaster can also decide if the reactions are directly online of if it's must be validate before.
The option is available on the admin/settings under "Moderation status".
-->
